---

### Founder Story Section

**Section Title (H2):**
"The Beginning: A Job, A Dream, and Real Hustle"

**Content:**
"Hi, I'm [Founder Name], founder of Askylinedigital.

In 2015, I was working a 9-to-5 job in tech, but I wanted more. I wanted to help businesses grow, not just build software for a corporation.

So I started freelancing on the side – working evenings and weekends, building websites and doing SEO for small businesses. I knew what it was like to work with a tight budget because I was living it myself.

**The Turning Point**

After a few years, I realized something: most digital agencies in India were either too expensive for small businesses, or too focused on fancy websites that didn't convert.

I saw business owners spending lakhs on websites that looked beautiful but brought zero customers. They didn't need more features – they needed more leads.

That's when I decided to build something different: a results-focused agency that helps Indian SMEs and startups actually GROW, not just get a pretty website.

**Today**

We've helped 50+ businesses across India increase their online leads and sales. From local service businesses to growing startups – we've been part of their growth journey.

The best part? I still personally review every project and client call. Because when you succeed, we succeed. And I never forget what it's like to be a business owner working with a tight budget."
